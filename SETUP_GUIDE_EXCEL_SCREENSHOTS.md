## What You Need to Do 📋

### Add the Excel Screenshots

The case study is **ready for images** - you just need to save 3 Excel screenshots to the `/IMAGES` folder.

**File locations:**
```
/Users/tickooo/Desktop/PORTFOLIO FOR DATA ANALYTICS/html5up-directive 2/IMAGES/
```

**Required files:**

| Filename | What to show | Size |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `homecare_raw_data.png` | RAW_DATA worksheet with table structure | 1400x900+ px |
| `homecare_kpi_summary.png` | KPI_Summary sheet with metrics | 1400x900+ px |
| `homecare_pivot_dashboard.png` | Pivot dashboard with slicers | 1400x900+ px |

### How to Create Screenshots

1. Open your `HOMECARE_PHARMACY_ANALYSIS.xlsx` in Excel
2. For each sheet, take a screenshot (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+4` or `Cmd+Shift+5`)
3. Save as PNG in the `/IMAGES` folder with the exact filenames above

**Pro tip:** Screenshot just the main content area (exclude toolbars) for a cleaner look.

The case study page has placeholders ready for these!
